"Bridging Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) to Biodiversity Literature Repository (BLR)" [2] aims to create a reusable corpus of verifiable digital representations (or digital copies) of existing biodiversity literature. This citable and redistributable collection is anchored in pdfs of known provenance (or origin).
